# Firestore JDBC Driver
With the growing popularity of firebase as a free hosting for beginner projects. The ability to use firebase in most of the springboot projects is still not supported yet. Typically since firestore is a NoSQL based database hence SQL based JPA wont work there.

This is whereÂ firestore-jdbc comes in. It provides the necessary conversions between the SQL from JPA as well as MySQL dialect based SQL statements into queries understandable by firestore. Simply plugging in the library to any springboot/hibernate/JPA based project will complete the integration. Essentially the library provides a barebone firebase jdbc driver that you can use in your java projects even without springboot.

## Features

All basic operations available in firestore are supported
https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/manage-data/add-data

## Installation
Release
```xml
<dependency>
   <groupId>io.github.shiveshnavin</groupId>
   <artifactId>firestore-jdbc</artifactId>
   <version>1.3.6</version>
</dependency>
```
Snapshot (Experimental)
```xml
<dependency>
   <groupId>io.github.shiveshnavin</groupId>
   <artifactId>firestore-jdbc</artifactId>
   <version>1.3.6-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
```
## Usage
1. Download the firebase service account file for your project
   https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup
2. Add these to `application.properties`

```properties
spring.datasource.url=path/to/your/service-account.json
spring.datasource.driver-class-name=io.github.shiveshnavin.firestore.jdbc.FirestoreJDBCDriver
```
3. [Only if you are using JPA/Hibernate] Create a `LocalSessionFactoryBean` bean in your `@Configuration` class and replace `com.example.domain.model` with your domain model package
```java
@Configuration
public class Config {

   @Autowired
   DataSource dataSource;
   @Bean
   public LocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBean entityManagerFactory() {
      HibernateJpaVendorAdapter vendorAdapter = new HibernateJpaVendorAdapter();
      vendorAdapter.setGenerateDdl(true);

      LocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBean factory = new LocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBean();
      Properties props = new Properties();
      props.put("hibernate.dialect", "org.hibernate.dialect.MySQLDialect");
      props.put("hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto", "none");
      factory.setJpaProperties(props);
      factory.setJpaVendorAdapter(vendorAdapter);
      
      // [Optional] In case you are using JPA , Add the packages containing your model POJO classes
      factory.setPackagesToScan(new String[]{"com.example.domain.model"});

      factory.setDataSource(dataSource);
      return factory;
   } 
}
```
4.  [Optional] In case you are using JPA , In all your Entity classes make sure to specify `@Table` and table name (case sensitive). Basically this is the collection name. If you skip explicitly adding the `name` then the collection name will be defined by JPA.
```java
@Entity
@Table(name="users")
public class User{
    @Id
    String id;
    String name;
}
```

## Additional Supported operations
Apart from normal CRUD the following operations are also supported. Please note that some of 
these are READ intensive operations
and must be used cautiously.
```sql
INSERT INTO mytable SELECT name as id, marks as science FROM omytable WHERE subject = 'science'
```

```sql
SELECT count(*) FROM mytable WHERE marks > 90
```

```sql
DROP TABLE mytable
```

```sql
SELECT concat('marks_',id) as mid, marks + 100 as marks_plus_100 FROM mytable
```

## Issues
#### SIGTERM while initializing JPA when using openjdk11
Try openjdk oracle 11.0.10
